"Dear Tenants,
Good progress is being made on cleanup and power restoration. We continue to expect power to be restored to the building in Late Friday / Early Saturday and I will continue to send daily emails to keep you in the loop on the progress being made.
	If you need something from your suite I will be available to help with that please call, text, or email if you need my assistance and we will be able to help out. 
	The West Grand Blvd Entrance will be closed until further notice but you can still access the building from 2nd Ave, Lothrop, or Lot 4. 
 We appreciate all your calls of support and your patience as we get NCO back open after the monumental storms that brought over two months of rain in a matter of hours.   Thank you!
Thanks,
Jordan
